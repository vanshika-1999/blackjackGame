This Python project implements a text-based Blackjack game using functions for card dealing, scoring, and game logic. It employs a random number generator for card selection and employs conditional statements to handle various game outcomes. The code uses clear screen functionality to maintain a clean interface between rounds. It offers a simple yet functional demonstration of core programming concepts, including data structures, loops, and user input processing.
